# coinFlip
One page app that allows you to simulate the coin flip.

- The idea is to make user input a value for the number of coin flips.
- User would be then able to click a big coin, to initialize a flip.
- The app would print out the Heads (H) and Tails (T) in a continuum of H and T letters.
- In separate section, the user would see how many Tails and how many Heads he's got.

- Bonus functionality would be for the coin to spin after pressing it.
- It would be a two-sides object, with one side spelling Tails, and the other one Heads.
